# ⭐ **My JavaScript Learning Progress (Today’s Update)**

Today I made solid progress in my JavaScript fundamentals.
Here’s what I learned:

---

## ✅ **1. Variables (var, let, const)**

* `var` → old and function-scoped
* `let` → modern, block-scoped
* `const` → fixed values (cannot reassign)
* Also learned about **hoisting** and the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** and how they affect variable access.

---

## ✅ **2. Data Types**

### **Primitive Types:**

string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, BigInt

### **Reference Types:**

array, object, function

I also understood how JavaScript handles **copying values vs copying references** — an important concept for avoiding bugs.

---

## ✅ **3. typeof & Type Coercion**

Some interesting JavaScript behaviors:

* `typeof null` → `"object"` (a long-standing JS bug)
* `"5" + 1` → `"51"` (string concatenation)
* `"5" - 1` → `4` (number conversion)
* `NaN === NaN` → false
* Learned about **truthy and falsy values** in conditions

---

Every day I’m getting more comfortable with JavaScript’s fundamentals.
Excited to continue learning and improving! 🚀
